adding a way to save a bookmark without opening it


Known issues:

- Bookmark title is 'unknown'.
  - This is because of a limitation of HTML itself, the title attribute that is normally used to name a bookmark is only present once the page is opened.
  - To fix we would need to create a suggestion based on the nearby elements but it does not seem to work at the moment.
 
Upcoming improvements that are worked on:
- Regular bookmark menu should open when saving the bookmark. This will improve user experience a lot.
